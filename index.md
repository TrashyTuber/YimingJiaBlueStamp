# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was managing to produce a MIDI sound by pressing a button and being able to adjust its volume through a potentiometer. Through coding, I managed to check when the button is being pressed and send out a Serial output which can be converted into MIDI. I also did the same for the potentiometer where it checks if there's a big enough change in the read of the potentiometer and then produce an output which can also be converted into MIDI. Through the MIDI message list, I learned what each of the number outputs does and that allowed the output to correspond with the correct function.
